MageForgeX (“I”, “me”, or “my”) operates as an individual developer offering Magento extensions via Adobe Marketplace.

I do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users who install my extensions.

If any data is required for extension functionality, it remains strictly within the user's Magento instance and is not transmitted externally.
